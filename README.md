Notebook, data exploring and creating a model to predict future stock values

I used a few different methods for the prediction and plotted the results for a visual representation.

## Working on: 

First draft finished, and first plots only linear regression plotted.
Next step is to train the model with the full data and plot it on the smaller graph. As well as incorporating new models.
